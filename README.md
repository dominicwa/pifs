PIFS stands for "PHP Image Framing Script". It resamples images so they fit into a frame whilst maintaining their original aspect ratio.

It can turn this:

![Images of different sizes](http://demo.dominicmanley.com/pifs/images/pifs_f.jpg)

Into this:

![Images framed using PIFS](http://demo.dominicmanley.com/pifs/images/pifs_t.jpg)

PIFS has been tested with PHP 5.4. It will probably still work on earlier versions. If not, try reverting e08542f4a93379e1d4987dd8a347a4ea89cf5184.
